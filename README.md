This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

Ruby version 2.4.5

DESCRIPTION:

A library and public website allowing users to view memes, contribute to the meme database, and leave reviews.






1) Version-locks dependencies to mutually compatible versions that we use elsewhere in the curriculum (e.g., React Router 3, not 4)
2) Configures Devise
3) Configures React with Webpacker (including react-webpacker)
4) Configures Karma, Jasmine, and Enzyme
5) Overrides certain Rails defaults to match the tools we teach (e.g., Postgres instead of SQLite, rspec instead of minitest)
